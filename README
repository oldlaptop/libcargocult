This package contains various Tcl procedures that are sufficiently useful I keep
auto-cargo-culting them into new programs all the time. While it's written to be
[package require]d as one unit, individual files follow individual themes and
can be cargo-culted themselves. Documentation is inline alongside individual
procedures.
